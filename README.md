## DIDA: The largest handwritten digit dataset
DIDA dataset is collected from the Swedish historical handwritten document images between the year 1800 and 1940. It is the largest handwritten digit dataset which is introduced to the Optical character recognition (OCR) community to help the researchers to test their optical handwritten character recognition methods. To generate DIDA, 250,000 single digits and 200,000 multi-digits are cropped from different document images. At this stage, we are going to share 250,000 single digit sub-dataset. 

The DIDA dataset has 250,000 handwritten digit samples with 10 different classes from 0 to 9, and each class contains 20,000-25,000 single digit images. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the largest one to present handwritten single digit samples in RGB color space with the original sizes and appearances (a). 

This simply in contrast with the existing publicly available handwritten digit datasets (e.g. MNIST (b)), where the digit images are size-normalized, denoised and cleaned.
