## DIDA: The largest handwritten digit dataset
DIDA dataset is collected from the Swedish historical handwritten document images between the year 1800 and 1940. It is the largest handwritten digit dataset which is introduced to the Optical character recognition (OCR) community to help the researchers to test their optical handwritten character recognition methods. To generate DIDA, 250,000 single digits and 200,000 multi-digits are cropped from different document images. At this stage, we are going to share 250,000 single digit sub-dataset.
